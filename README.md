# Which-debts-are-worth-the-bank-s-effort-

|| Introduction

In this project, I evaluate how different levels of debts affect banks' recovery strategies

|| Languages & Tools

Python & Jupyter Notebook

|| Methodologies

First, I explored the data, and found that the bank has different recovery strategy based on the  the expected recovery amount. The threshold are set to be $1000. A level higher, $50 more was set to run the strategy.

Then, I inspected that if other factors such as ages and genders affect the actual recovery amount, by visualzing using scatter plots and conducting Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test.

Last but not least, I built a regression model to test whether the expected recovery amount (X) and the actual recovery amount (y) are correlated. I also added a threshold to see whether the $50 is approariate for running per higher strategy.
